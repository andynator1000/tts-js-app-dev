Create an Array named superHeroes

Inside the superHeroes array create the following arrays: 
["Batman", "Bruce Wayne"],
["Spiderman", "Peter Parker"],
["The Flash", "Barry Allen"]

Create a revealArray variable with the following array: ["Batman", "Spiderman"]

Map over the revealArray to get an array like: ["Batman is Bruce Wayne", "Spiderman is Peter Parker"];
*Hint: You should use find on the superHeroes array to get the array with the hero's real name*
*Hint2: create a function that does this for one superhero name and then use map on the array to get all of the requested arrays*

Join the entries in the resulting array and log them to the console.
